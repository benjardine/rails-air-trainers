Rails app generated with lewagon/rails-templates, created by the Le Wagon coding bootcamp team.

Air-Trainers is an Airbnb-like marketplace envrionment, where you can showcase your upcoming training sessions that you are attending, while also log in as a trainer to create sessions for other to attend. This app was built using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Cloudinary and hosted on both Github and Heroku.

This app was codeveloped in just 5 days at Le Wagon's Web Development Bootcamp. This was our first experience working collaboratively on a project, and building a prototype from scratch.
